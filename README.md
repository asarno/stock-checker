# Stock ticker challenge

Welcome, entrepid developer!  Your mission, should you choose to take it, is to build a financial stock ticker SPA using the [Alpha Avantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and the tooling of your choice!

Please take a look below at some project guidelines:

## Project Conditions

- **3 hour time limit** (if you get it done quicker, that's great! but please do not spend more than 3 hours)

- Please push all source code to your personal repository
  - Send us a link to your repo by [DATE]

- We've provided a [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) boilerplate in this repo to get you up and running, but feel free to disregard if you have your preference of libraries / tools!

## Requirements

- Build a **stock ticker widget** within a Single Page App page route

- Utilize the [Alpha Avantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) to draw dynamic fintech data to hydrate this widget
  - You will need to provision a free API Key

- Ensure any components, state, or controllers are covered by unit tests.
  - **Be sure to write cogent tests that are self documenting and test both happy + failure paths!**
